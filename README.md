# Bitcoin-Project
This is a Tryandhackme Project under Python Basics.
You've invested in Bitcoin and want to write a program that tells you when the value of Bitcoin falls below a particular value in dollars.

In the code editor, click on the bitcoin.py tab. Write a function called bitcoinToUSD with two parameters: bitcoin_amount, the amount of Bitcoin you own, and bitcoin_value_usd, the value of bitcoin in USD. The function should return usd_value, which is your bitcoin value in USD (to calculate this, in the function, you times bitcoin_amount variable by bitcoin_value_usd variable and return the value). The start of the function should look like this:

def bitcoinToUSD(bitcoin_amount, bitcoin_value_usd):
Once you've written the bitcoinToUSD function, use it to calculate the value of your Bitcoin in USD, and then create an if statement to determine if the value falls below $30,000;
